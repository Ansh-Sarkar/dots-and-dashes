Yeah, right

This is an HUD interface entirely made in conky with a bit of py and sh here and there.
Got inspo from various vidya and films for creating this and it's projected to be rendered on a 1920x1080 display.
If you have greater or lower resolution, please feel free to adapt it for your needs.


First of all i want to credit 


Features:

1. Calendar... One day i felt like re-inventig hot-water so there it is. What is so special about this calendar? The fact that you can mark days to be displayed in the calendar and the option to associate notes to them;

2. A weather widget full of info and forecast. For this one you will need to «pip install pywapi»; 

3. Speedtest infos, which you will need to 'pip install speedtest-cli' in order to make it work.

4. A dbus-monitor i made in python ( reinventing hot-water yet again ) which serves the purpose of collecting notifications from "whatsie" - a WhatsApp Web client for Desktop, created by talented https://github.com/Aluxian/Whatsie - and pipe the «Sender» to the conky.

5. Awesome wallpaper and awesome HUD designed by me :)
